# CBZ

A Python script to convert a directory of images to a CBZ comicbook file.

## Usage

`python cbz.py path/to/image/directory` it will ask you for a comic name. **DO NOT INCLUDE A TRAILING SLASH IN THE PATH OTHERWISE IT WON'T DETECT THE CHAPTER NAME.**

## Notes

Converted files are stored in the current working directory.
